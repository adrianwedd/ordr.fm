## Security Scan Summary

### Issues by Severity
- **High/Critical**: 0
- **Medium**: 0  
- **Low/Info**: 0

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**: Address any high/critical severity issues
2. **Regular Monitoring**: Schedule weekly security scans
3. **Dependency Updates**: Keep dependencies updated with automated tools
4. **Code Reviews**: Include security review in development process
5. **Security Headers**: Ensure all security headers are properly configured

### Next Steps

- Review all flagged issues in detail
- Implement fixes for medium and high priority items
- Schedule automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Consider implementing additional security tools (SAST/DAST)
