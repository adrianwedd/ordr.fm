# ordr.fm Test Report - Session 2

**Date:** 2025-08-04  
**Focus:** Bug fixes and initial testing

## ‚úÖ Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Single Album Detection** (FIXED)
- **Issue:** When source was a single album, script found 0 albums
- **Solution:** Added detection for when source directory itself contains audio files
- **Result:** Now correctly processes single albums as source

### 2. **Quality Detection** (FIXED)
- **Issue:** All albums showing as "UnknownQuality" 
- **Solution:** Fixed case sensitivity in file extension comparison (mp3 vs MP3)
- **Result:** Now correctly detects Lossy/Lossless/Mixed

## üìä Test Results

### Test Album: Eyephone - Devolution (2001)
**Location:** `/home/plex/Music/Artists/Atom Heart/atom heart - devolution`

#### Metadata Found:
- Artist: Eyephone (not Atom Heart - pseudonym issue!)
- Album: Devolution
- Year: 2001
- Genre: Rock
- Quality: Lossy (MP3 160kbps)
- Tracks: 2 (one incomplete)

#### Organization Decision:
- Mode: artist (default)
- Path: `/home/plex/Music/sorted_music/Lossy/Eyephone/Devolution (2001)/`
- Files would be renamed with proper formatting

#### Key Observations:
1. **Artist Pseudonym Issue**: Album is in "Atom Heart" folder but metadata shows "Eyephone"
2. **Incomplete Files**: Script handles "INCOMPLETE~" prefix correctly
3. **Associated Files**: .asd and .nfo files present but not handled yet

## üîç Issues Discovered

### 1. **Artist Alias Problem** (Issue #26)
- Many electronic artists use pseudonyms
- Same physical artist appears as different artists in metadata
- Example: Atom Heart = Eyephone = Atom‚Ñ¢ = Uwe Schmidt
- Need robust alias resolution

### 2. **Discogs Authentication Required**
- API returns: "You must authenticate to access this resource"
- Need to configure DISCOGS_USER_TOKEN in ordr.fm.conf
- Without Discogs, no catalog numbers or label data

### 3. **Associated Files Not Handled**
- .asd files (Ableton Live)
- .nfo files (album info)
- Should be preserved with albums

## üìà Testing Progress

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Single album source | ‚úÖ PASS | Fixed and working |
| Quality detection | ‚úÖ PASS | Fixed case sensitivity |
| Basic organization | ‚úÖ PASS | Correct path structure |
| Artist alias resolution | ‚ùå FAIL | Needs Discogs or manual config |
| Discogs integration | ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED | Needs API token |
| Electronic organization | ‚è≥ UNTESTED | Requires Discogs data |
| Backup to Google Drive | ‚è≥ PENDING | rclone configured, ready to test |

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. **Configure Discogs API Token**
   ```bash
   # Get token from https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers
   # Add to ordr.fm.conf:
   DISCOGS_USER_TOKEN="your_token_here"
   ```

2. **Test Artist Alias Resolution**
   ```bash
   # Configure known aliases
   ARTIST_ALIAS_GROUPS="Uwe Schmidt,Atom TM,Atom Heart,Eyephone,Senor Coconut"
   GROUP_ARTIST_ALIASES=1
   ```

3. **Create Small Backup**
   ```bash
   # Backup test data first
   rclone sync /tmp/test_music gdrive:ordrfm_backup/test_$(date +%Y%m%d)
   ```

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Configure Discogs API token
- [ ] Test with Discogs enrichment
- [ ] Verify artist alias resolution
- [ ] Test label organization mode
- [ ] Check compilation detection
- [ ] Validate remix detection
- [ ] Test on larger subset (10-20 albums)
- [ ] Create full backup before production

## üìä Collection Statistics

### Atom Heart Collection:
- **Size:** 7.4GB
- **Albums:** 65 directories
- **Notable:** Many likely pseudonyms (Eyephone, Atom‚Ñ¢, etc.)
- **Perfect for:** Testing alias resolution

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Status

- ‚úÖ All tests in dry-run mode
- ‚úÖ Single album fix tested and working
- ‚úÖ Quality detection fix tested and working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Google Drive backup pending (rclone ready)
- ‚úÖ No destructive operations performed

## üí° Recommendations

1. **Priority 1:** Get Discogs API token for metadata enrichment
2. **Priority 2:** Configure artist aliases for Atom Heart/Uwe Schmidt
3. **Priority 3:** Test backup strategy on small subset
4. **Priority 4:** Run full test suite with fixes

---

**Conclusion:** Core functionality working after fixes. Main blocker is Discogs authentication for advanced features. Artist pseudonym handling is critical for electronic music collections.
