## Project Overview

This is a professional-grade music organization tool written in Bash with advanced features for electronic music collections. The main script (`ordr.fm.sh`) analyzes metadata, enriches it via Discogs API, intelligently organizes music based on quality and metadata patterns, and tracks all operations in a database for undo/recovery.

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Main Script**: `ordr.fm.sh` - Contains all functionality including metadata extraction, album processing, and file organization
- **Visualization Dashboard**: `visualization/` - Modern web interface with advanced search, mobile support, and real-time updates
- **Configuration**: `ordr.fm.conf` - Default configuration file with directory paths and verbosity settings
- **Specifications**: `SPECIFICATIONS.md` - Comprehensive technical specifications for the script's behavior
- **Documentation**: `README.md` - Project overview and planned features

### Visualization Dashboard Features

- **Advanced Search & Filtering**: Multi-criteria search with real-time results, saved presets, and search history
- **Mobile-First Design**: Touch gestures, swipe navigation, pull-to-refresh, and responsive layouts
- **Progressive Web App**: Installable on mobile devices with offline capabilities and service worker caching
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live statistics and processing updates
- **Multiple View Modes**: Table and grid views with sorting and filtering capabilities
- **Collection Analytics**: Health scores, duplicate detection, and insights visualization
- **Audio Player Integration**: Built-in streaming player with waveform visualization and playlist management
- **Metadata Editing**: In-place editing interface with change tracking and validation
- **Cloud Backup Management**: Google Drive backup with progress monitoring and status reporting
- **Performance Optimization**: Database query caching with 5-minute TTL and connection monitoring
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Retry logic, connection monitoring, and user-friendly error reporting

### Key Architecture Patterns

- **Album-Centric Processing**: The script treats entire directories as albums, ensuring tracks stay together
- **Metadata-Driven Organization**: Uses `exiftool` and `jq` to extract and process audio file metadata (ID3, Vorbis, etc.)
- **Quality-Based Classification**: Organizes albums into `Lossless`, `Lossy`, or `Mixed` top-level directories
- **Safety-First Design**: Defaults to dry-run mode, requires explicit `--move` flag for actual file operations
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All operations are logged with timestamps and different verbosity levels

### Directory Structure Logic

Target structure: `<DEST_DIR>/<Quality>/<Album Artist>/<Album Title> (<Year>)/[Disc <N>/]<Track> - <Title>.<ext>`

Quality determination:
- **Lossless**: Contains any FLAC, WAV, AIFF, or ALAC files
- **Mixed**: Contains both lossless and lossy formats
- **Lossy**: Contains only MP3, AAC, M4A, or OGG files

## Dependencies

Required command-line tools (checked at startup):
- `exiftool` - Metadata extraction from audio files
- `jq` - JSON parsing for exiftool output
- `rsync` - File operations (planned)
- `md5sum` - Checksum verification (planned)

## Common Commands

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Dry run (default, safe mode)
./ordr.fm.sh

# Actual file operations (use with caution)
./ordr.fm.sh --move

# Verbose debugging output
./ordr.fm.sh --verbose

# Custom source directory
./ordr.fm.sh --source "/path/to/music"

# Custom destination
./ordr.fm.sh --destination "/path/to/organized"
```

### Electronic Music Organization
```bash
# Enable all electronic features with intelligent routing
./ordr.fm.sh --enable-electronic --discogs --move

# Use label-based organization
./ordr.fm.sh --organization-mode label --discogs

# Enable remix separation
./ordr.fm.sh --enable-remixes --discogs

# Full electronic setup with vinyl markers
./ordr.fm.sh --enable-electronic --enable-vinyl-markers --discogs
```

### Discogs Integration
```bash
# Enable Discogs enrichment (requires API token in config)
./ordr.fm.sh --discogs

# Override Discogs confidence threshold
./ordr.fm.sh --discogs --confidence-threshold 0.8

# Force fresh Discogs lookups (ignore cache)
./ordr.fm.sh --discogs --force-refresh
```

### Configuration Override
```bash
# Override specific paths
./ordr.fm.sh --source "/custom/source" --destination "/custom/dest" --unsorted "/custom/unsorted"

# Custom log file
./ordr.fm.sh --log-file "/custom/path/ordr.fm.log"

# Custom database paths
./ordr.fm.sh --state-db "/path/to/state.db" --metadata-db "/path/to/metadata.db"
```

- Per-album error isolation (problematic albums moved to unsorted)
- Comprehensive logging with different severity levels
- Safe defaults (dry-run mode, no overwriting)

## Testing

Comprehensive test framework implemented with 90%+ code coverage:

### Test Framework
```bash
# Run all tests (unit, integration, end-to-end)
./run_all_tests.sh

# Run specific test suites
./tests/unit/test_argument_parsing.sh
./tests/unit/test_metadata_functions.sh
./tests/integration/test_web_api_integration.sh
./tests/integration/test_end_to_end_workflow.sh

# Run browser tests
cd visualization && npm test
```

### Coverage Areas
- ‚úÖ **Unit Tests**: 60+ test cases covering argument parsing, metadata processing, validation
- ‚úÖ **Integration Tests**: 30+ test cases covering API endpoints, workflows, database operations  
- ‚úÖ **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflow validation with mock data
- ‚úÖ **Browser Tests**: 150+ Playwright tests covering PWA functionality across browsers
- ‚úÖ **Performance Tests**: Response time validation and scalability testing

### Manual Testing
For new features, supplement automated tests with:
1. Dry-run mode first (`./ordr.fm.sh`)
2. Small test directories before processing large collections
3. Review log files in detail before using `--move` flag

## Safety Features

- **Dry-run by default**: All operations are simulated unless `--move` is explicitly used
- **Timestamped unsorted directories**: Problematic files are moved to `unsorted_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`
- **No overwriting**: Script avoids overwriting existing organized music
- **Comprehensive logging**: All decisions and operations are logged for audit trails
- **Database tracking**: All operations recorded for undo/recovery
- **Smart fallback logic**: Prevents sparse folders (e.g., single release in label folder)

## Configuration Tips

### For Electronic Music Collections
```bash
# ordr.fm.conf recommended settings
ORGANIZATION_MODE="hybrid"          # Intelligent routing
MIN_LABEL_RELEASES=3                # Avoid sparse label folders
SEPARATE_REMIXES=1                  # Organize remixes separately
DISCOGS_ENABLED=1                   # Get catalog numbers & labels
DISCOGS_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.7    # Good balance
GROUP_ARTIST_ALIASES=1              # Handle multiple artist names
```

### Artist Alias Groups
```bash
# Example for electronic artists with multiple aliases
ARTIST_ALIAS_GROUPS="Uwe Schmidt,Atom TM,Atom Heart,Senor Coconut,Atomu Shinzo|Aphex Twin,AFX,Polygon Window,Caustic Window|Four Tet,Kieran Hebden,00110100 01010100"
```

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Why Bash?** Maximum portability, no dependencies beyond standard Unix tools
2. **Why SQLite?** Lightweight, file-based, perfect for tracking metadata
3. **Why Discogs API?** Best electronic music metadata, catalog numbers crucial for organization
4. **Why dry-run default?** Safety first - users can preview changes before committing
5. **Why hybrid mode?** Intelligent routing prevents common organization problems
