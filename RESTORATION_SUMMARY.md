- ‚úÖ Database properly initialized with correct schema
- ‚úÖ API endpoints responding (health, albums, tracks)
- ‚úÖ Security headers enabled (CSP, CORS, Helmet)
- ‚úÖ Environment-based configuration for secrets

### Partially Working:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Script execution has timeout issues with certain operations

4. **Strengthen Security**: Add comprehensive input sanitization
5. **Update Documentation**: Align all docs with actual functionality
6. **Add Checksum Verification**: Implement MD5/SHA verification for file integrity
7. **Improve Error Messages**: Make user feedback clearer and more actionable

## üéØ Achievement Summary

**Fixed: 10/15 critical issues (67%)**
- Core functionality restored
- Security vulnerabilities addressed
