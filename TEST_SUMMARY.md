# ordr.fm Testing Summary

**Date:** 2025-08-04  
**Session Focus:** Non-destructive testing framework with backup strategy

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. **Testing Framework** (`test_framework.sh`)
- Comprehensive dry-run testing system
- Persistent database for each test run
- Metrics extraction (errors, warnings, anomalies)
- HTML and JSON report generation
- Anomaly detection for edge cases

### 2. **Backup Strategy** (`backup_strategy.sh`)
- rclone integration for Google Drive backups
- Manifest generation with checksums
- Incremental backup support
- Restore capability
- Pre-organization snapshots

### 3. **Safe Test Runner** (`safe_test_runner.sh`)
- Mandatory backup verification
- Progressive testing on library subsets
- Database integrity checks
- Comprehensive metrics collection
- Automatic report generation

### 4. **Visualization Dashboard**
- Web interface for data inspection
- Real-time statistics and charts
- Artist alias network visualization
- Move history tracking
- Test database included

## 📊 Test Results

### Initial Test on Atom Heart Collection
- **Location:** `/home/plex/Music/Artists/Atom Heart/`
- **Albums Found:** 65 directories
- **Sample Album:** "Pure Funktion (AFTER 001)" - 1994
- **Metadata Quality:** Good (Artist, Album, Year present)
- **File Naming:** Includes vinyl side markers (A1, B1)

### Key Observations

1. **Real Music Library Structure:**
   - Artist folders contain multiple album subdirectories
   - Mixed naming conventions (lowercase, special characters)
   - Vinyl rips include side markers in filenames
   - Some incomplete files marked with "INCOMPLETE~" prefix

2. **Metadata Patterns:**
   - Consistent artist tags (Atom Heart)
   - Album titles include catalog numbers
   - Year information generally present
   - Genre tags present (Techno)

3. **Edge Cases Identified:**
   - Special characters in directory names (apostrophes, parentheses)
   - Incomplete files that need special handling
   - Mixed file formats (.mp3, .asd sidecar files)
   - NFO files present in some albums

## 🔍 Anomalies & Issues to Address

1. **Script Behavior:**
   - When given a single album as source, treats it as empty source
   - Need to differentiate between source directory and album directory
   - Log truncation in verbose mode (needs buffer management)

2. **Testing Framework:**
   - Alias groups argument needs careful escaping
   - State database vs metadata database confusion
   - Need to handle both database schemas

3. **Real Data Challenges:**
   - Incomplete files need special handling
   - Sidecar files (.asd) should be preserved with audio
   - NFO files should be preserved with albums

## 📈 Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Fix Script Logic:**
   ```bash
   # Detect if source is an album vs collection
   # Handle incomplete files appropriately
   # Preserve associated files (nfo, asd)
   ```

2. **Run Comprehensive Tests:**
   ```bash
   # Test full Atom Heart collection
   ./safe_test_runner.sh --no-backup
   
   # Test with Discogs enrichment
   ./ordr.fm.sh --source "/home/plex/Music/Artists" \
                --enable-electronic \
                --discogs \
                --group-aliases
   ```

3. **Backup Before Production:**
   ```bash
   # Create full backup
   ./backup_strategy.sh --quick "/home/plex/Music"
   
   # Verify backup
   rclone size gdrive:ordrfm_backup/latest
   ```

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test artist alias resolution (Atom Heart → Uwe Schmidt)
- [ ] Test label organization with electronic releases
- [ ] Test compilation detection
- [ ] Test remix detection with actual remixes
- [ ] Verify database captures all metadata
- [ ] Check anomaly detection accuracy
- [ ] Test incremental processing
- [ ] Verify Discogs API integration

## 🛡️ Safety Measures

1. **All tests run in dry-run mode** (no actual file moves)
2. **Backup strategy implemented** (rclone to Google Drive)
3. **Persistent databases** track all operations
4. **Comprehensive logging** for audit trail
5. **Anomaly detection** identifies issues before production

## 📝 Configuration Recommendations

```bash
# ordr.fm.conf for electronic music
ORGANIZATION_MODE="hybrid"
MIN_LABEL_RELEASES=3
SEPARATE_REMIXES=1
DISCOGS_ENABLED=1
GROUP_ARTIST_ALIASES=1
ARTIST_ALIAS_GROUPS="Uwe Schmidt,Atom TM,Atom Heart,Senor Coconut,Atomu Shinzo,Atom™"
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Before moving to production (--move flag):

2. ⏳ All test runs complete without errors
3. ⏳ Anomalies reviewed and acceptable
4. ⏳ Database integrity verified
5. ⏳ Organization structure validated
6. ⏳ At least 95% Discogs match rate
7. ⏳ Artist aliases properly resolved

## 📊 Metrics Target

- **Processing Success Rate:** >98%
- **Discogs Match Rate:** >90%
- **Anomaly Rate:** <5%
- **Database Capture:** 100%
- **Backup Coverage:** 100%
