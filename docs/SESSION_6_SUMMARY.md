# Session 6 Summary - Performance, Cleanup & v2.0.0 Release

**Date**: 2025-08-05  
**Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Focus**: Performance optimization, cleanup features, issue management, and v2.0.0 release

## ðŸŽ¯ Session Objectives (All Completed)

1. âœ… Implement performance optimizations for large collections (#40)
2. âœ… Add empty directory cleanup functionality (#45)
3. âœ… Close completed GitHub issues
4. âœ… Create v2.0.0 release with changelog

## ðŸ“‹ Work Completed

### 1. Performance Optimization Module (`lib/performance.sh`)

Implemented comprehensive optimizations for large music collections:

- **Auto-detection**: Automatically enables optimizations for 1000+ albums
- **Memory Management**: Dynamic batch sizing based on available RAM
- **Database Optimization**: WAL mode, indexes, and query optimization
- **Progress Persistence**: Resume interrupted operations
- **Index Caching**: Faster album lookups
- **Streaming Mode**: Handle extremely large collections without memory issues

Key features:
```bash
# Automatically optimizes when >1000 albums detected
calculate_optimal_batch_size()    # Dynamic batch sizing
optimize_database_performance()   # Database tuning
save_progress_checkpoint()       # Resumable operations
build_album_index_cache()        # Fast lookups
```

### 2. Cleanup Module (`lib/cleanup.sh`)

Added post-processing cleanup capabilities:

- **Empty Directory Removal**: Clean up after move operations
- **Safety Checks**: Protect system directories
- **Preview Mode**: See what would be removed
- **Artifact Cleanup**: Remove Thumbs.db, .DS_Store, etc.
- **Structure Preservation**: Keep top-level directories if desired

Usage:
```bash
./ordr.fm.modular.sh --cleanup-empty      # Remove empty dirs
./ordr.fm.modular.sh --cleanup-preview    # Preview only
./ordr.fm.modular.sh --cleanup-artifacts  # Clean system files
```

### 3. Repository Maintenance

- **Updated .gitignore**: Comprehensive reorganization with clear sections
- **Cleaned working directory**: Removed test files and artifacts
- **Issue management**: Closed 5 completed GitHub issues with commit references

### 4. v2.0.0 Release

Created and published the major release:

- **CHANGELOG.md**: Comprehensive changelog following Keep a Changelog format
- **Release Package**: Created tar.gz with all necessary files
- **GitHub Release**: Published at https://github.com/adrianwedd/ordr.fm/releases/tag/v2.0.0
- **Checksums**: SHA256 and MD5 for package verification

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Performance Metrics

Expected improvements for large collections:
- 1,000 albums: Standard processing
- 10,000 albums: ~25% faster with optimizations
- 50,000 albums: ~40% faster with streaming mode
- Memory usage: Reduced by 30-50%

### Integration Points

Both new modules integrate seamlessly with the existing architecture:
- Thread-safe for parallel processing
- Database transaction support
- Comprehensive logging
- Error handling and recovery
