git tag -a v2.1.0 -m "Release v2.1.0: Complete Docker deployment with Node.js MusicBrainz integration"
git push origin v2.1.0
```

### 2. Docker Hub Release
```bash
# Build and push multi-architecture images
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t ghcr.io/adrianwedd/ordr.fm:2.1.0 -t ghcr.io/adrianwedd/ordr.fm:latest --push .
```

### 3. GitHub Release Creation

- Release assets (deployment bundle) attached automatically

### 4. Documentation Updates
- [x] Update main README.md with v2.1.0 features
- [x] Ensure all links point to correct version
- [x] Update installation instructions
- [x] Add troubleshooting for common Docker issues

## Post-Release Tasks

### Immediate (Day 1)
- [ ] Monitor GitHub Actions for successful builds
- [ ] Test Docker Hub image pulls on different architectures
- [ ] Respond to any installation issues reported
- [ ] Update project website/documentation links

### Short-term (Week 1)  
- [ ] Gather user feedback on Docker deployment
- [ ] Address any critical bugs or security issues
- [ ] Update development roadmap based on user requests
- [ ] Create tutorial videos or blog posts

### Medium-term (Month 1)
- [ ] Analyze usage metrics from deployments
- [ ] Plan next major feature release
- [ ] Consider integration with other tools
- [ ] Evaluate performance optimizations

## Critical Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] Docker images build successfully on all target platforms
- [ ] All GitHub Actions workflows pass
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] Database schema initializes correctly
- [ ] API endpoints respond within acceptable timeframes

### User Experience Metrics  
- [ ] Quick start instructions work for new users
- [ ] Docker deployment completes in < 5 minutes
- [ ] Web interface loads and displays data correctly
- [ ] Music organization processes albums without errors
- [ ] Documentation answers common questions

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Architecture-Specific
- SQLite tests may fail on ARM64 (Raspberry Pi) - non-blocking for CI/CD
- Performance may vary based on music collection size
- Docker build times longer on ARM platforms

### API Dependencies
- Requires external network access for Discogs/MusicBrainz
- Rate limiting may affect large collection processing
- API token configuration required for full functionality

### Planned Improvements (Next Release)
- Enhanced caching for API responses
- Batch processing optimizations
- Additional visualization types
- Mobile-responsive web interface
- Plugin architecture for custom organization rules

## Emergency Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered post-release:

1. **Immediate Response**
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous stable tag
   git tag -d v2.1.0
   git push --delete origin v2.1.0
   
   # Update Docker images to previous version
   docker tag ghcr.io/adrianwedd/ordr.fm:2.0.0 ghcr.io/adrianwedd/ordr.fm:latest
   docker push ghcr.io/adrianwedd/ordr.fm:latest
   ```

2. **Communication**
   - Update GitHub release with known issues
   - Post issue in repository with workarounds
   - Update documentation with temporary fixes
   - Notify users via commit messages

3. **Fix and Re-release**
   - Create hotfix branch from last stable commit
   - Apply minimal fix for critical issue
   - Test thoroughly on affected platforms
   - Release as v2.1.1 with patch notes
